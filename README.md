##NOTE: This site was written in January 2008 to begin learning HTML/CSS!##


As such, it may be slightly out of date with current versions of HTML and CSS (5 and 3, respectively). I wanted to freshen my html knowledge so I picked up a book about learning HTML the right way - by using CSS to style the page and by NOT using html tables to design and lay out the page.

Admittedly, there is not much to it. But this should make it easy to follow and understand due to how simple it is. 

As you browse it, you will notice it is incomplete. I didn't work on it for more than a couple of weeks because I got busy with a LOT of life things, and I eventually forgot about it. I do plan to pick it back up again though to continue learning, but with HTML5 and CSS3.
